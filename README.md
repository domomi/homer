# Homer - community-based, real-time housing marketplace

Homer is a community-based, real-time housing marketplace which empowers you to find, compare and get alerts on rental homes from your community using the logic you define. Renters and homeowners use Homer everyday to improve their rental journey and shape the future of cities.

This repo is a work in progress. In fact, your first pull request could be to fix or add to this doc. Reach out to your team lead or anyone on the engineering team with questions, or try the [Homer "hack at home" Slack workspace](https://athomehack.slack.com/).

## App Audience
Homer has two primary audiences.
- *Home-renters*: This person is seeking a new rental home, and may be moving from another rental home. Providing source code and open source projects is one way to solicit help from the renters that benefit from the finished web-app product.
- *Home-owners*: This person is an individual or company more generally with multiple rental homes wishing to interact with renters and lease their home using Homer. Historically, we engaged home-owners through networking events (e.g., UDI and YPO) and individuals sought us out because they wanted to learn more about Homer algorithms to help with housing challenges. [Open Tasks](link to Issues tagged "housing challenges"). Using Housing Challenges is one way the public can engage with Homer and help shape the future of cities.

## Features

For Homer to flourish, it's important that people understand how it works! We are crafting a scalable, well-designed, fully open source web-app. 

- Rules are written in Python; they can utilize any Python libraries or functions 
- Serverless design is cheaper, easier to maintain, and scales to terabytes per day
- Deployment is automated: simple, safe and repeatable for any IBM account
- Secure by design: least-privilege execution, containerized analysis, and encrypted data storage
- Merge similar issues and automatically promote new features if they are not too niche
