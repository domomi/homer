Homer is a community-based, real-time housing marketplace that helps you find, compare and get alerts on rental homes from your community using the logic you define. Renters and homeowners use Homer everyday to improve their rental journey and shape the future of cities. It is an open source project supported by the [IBM Builder Program](https://developer.ibm.com/startups/) and grant from [New Ventures BC](www.newventuresbc.com).

This repo is a work in progress. In fact, your first pull request could be to fix or add to this doc. Reach out to your team lead or anyone on the engineering team with questions, or try the [Homer "hack at home" Slack workspace](https://thehomer.slack.com/).

## Project brief

For Homer to flourish, it's important that people understand how it works! We are crafting a scalable, well-designed, fully open source web-app. 

- Rules are written in Python; they can utilize any Python libraries or functions 
- Serverless design is cheaper, easier to maintain, and scales to terabytes per day
- Deployment is automated: simple, safe and repeatable for any IBM account
- Secure by design: least-privilege execution, containerized analysis, and encrypted data storage
- Merge similar issues and automatically promote new features if they are not too niche 

## Sharing
