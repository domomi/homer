# Onboarding

You have hopefully been onboarded by our people team. You know the first rule, always keep snacks nearby! You probably have a computer that's plugged in and have set some things up. Awesome.

Now, it's time to learn about our engineering -- who we are and how we operate. We've broken this down into two
pieces:

1. [An introduction to our engineering workflow](/onboarding/engineering-introduction.md)
2. A guide for getting started. Your manager should have created a github issue for you based on our
   [onboarding template](https://github.com/artsy/potential/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/engineering-onboarding.md),
   and even a second one based on our
   [manager onboarding template](https://github.com/artsy/potential/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/engineering-manager-onboarding.md)
   if youâ€™re a new engineering manager. If you find issues, please submit a pull request to update the template!

Feel free to start poking around. You'll need to enlist the help from your team, your peers, and everyone else collaborating to get through the project milestones.
