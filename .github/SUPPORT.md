## Using Homer (Partners)

**Homer (Partners)** users have access to email support via the support in-app.

## Why not GitHub?

GitHub is our office, it's the place where our development team does its work. We use the issue list
to keep track of bugs and the features that we are working on. We do this openly for transparency.

With the slack community workspace, you can leverage the knowledge of our wider community to get help with any problems you are
having with Homer. Please keep in mind that Homer is a startup, and free support is provided by the goodwill
of our wonderful community members.
