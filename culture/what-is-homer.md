# Homer in a Nutshell

Homer isn't as well known (yet) for our work in the open source domain, but as developers we regularly get asked "What is
Homer?" Well, Homer pays our wages, so we probably owe you and the organization an explanation.

## Homer Vision

> A future where everyone feels at home every day.

## Homer Mission

> Expand the housing market to support more people around the world.

## Homer Values

Homer has 5 core values:

### Art meets Science

### Openness

## What does this mean in practice?

We map large aspects of the housing world in our app and website: {insert web-app address}.

> Homer is the global platform for discovering and renting homes. Homer partners with leading real estate professionals,
> international developers, housing services, and communities to create the world’s largest marketplace for housing. Homer’s
> technology enables the growth of the entire housing market by effectively connecting supply and demand at a global
> scale. Homer empowers a global audience to learn about, discover, and interact with homes. Currently emerging from beta, Homer is headquartered in Vancouver, BC with remote collaborators across the globe.

### How do we make money?

> Homer has 3 businesses: _Listings_, _Auctions_ and _Content_.

> **Market Insights**: Homer [housing partners](https://www.homer.domomi.com/homes) pay a monthly subscription fee to access
> market data from an unlimited number of homes for rent, plus a host of other benefits. They do not pay a commission fee on
> rental leases made through Homer.

> **Beacons**: In 2020 Homer expanded into helping people host "in search of" (ISO) beacons on our platform. Much like our Listings,
> any user is able to create a Beacon and set their own budget. Check out
> [current Beacons on Homer](https://www.homer.domomi.com/beacons).

> **Content**: We are also working on making Homer a go-to platform for brands to co-create and distribute home-related content
> that engages a global renter and home-owner audience. In 2020 we are preparing to debute our first sponsored content feature on Homer,
> a [series of purpose-built rental homes around Vancouver, BC in partnership with Framework](https://www.homer.domomi.com/framework).

### How does the Engineering team work?

We've documented what we consider to be our
[Engineering principles](https://github.com/domomi/homer/blob/master/culture/engineering-principles.md), which help
differentiate our team and introduce new collaborators to the Homer culture.
